Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Git provides powerful features such as branching, merging, and rebasing, which enable developers to experiment with new ideas and collaborate efficiently. With Git, every developer has a complete copy of the project history, ensuring that no data is lost and changes can be tracked and reverted if necessary. Git is widely used in the software industry and is an essential tool for modern software development.
