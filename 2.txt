Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to predict and generate text based on the input they receive. LLMs can perform a variety of tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and text generation. Examples of LLMs include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT. These models have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing and have numerous applications in areas like chatbots, content creation, and language translation.

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
