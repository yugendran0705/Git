Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to predict and generate text based on the input they receive. LLMs can perform a variety of tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and text generation. Examples of LLMs include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT. These models have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing and have numerous applications in areas like chatbots, content creation, and language translation.
